Wabel's Zoho-CRM Database copier
================================

What is this?
-------------

This project is a set of tools to help you copy your Zoho CRM records directly into your database.
The tool will create new tables in your database matching Zoho records. If you are looking to synchronize
data from ZohoCRM with your own tables, you should rather have a look at [ZohoCRM Sync](https://github.com/Wabel/zoho-crm-sync).
It is built on top of the [ZohoCRM ORM](https://github.com/Wabel/zoho-crm-orm).
Before reading further you should get used to working with [ZohoCRM ORM](https://github.com/Wabel/zoho-crm-orm),
so if you do not know this library, [STOP READING NOW and follow this link](https://github.com/Wabel/zoho-crm-orm).

How does it work?
